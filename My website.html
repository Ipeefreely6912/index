<h1>Home made banana bread with chocolate chips.</h1>
<p>There's a lot of different banana bread recipes on the web, I personally have roughly four different recipes for everyone in my life. My dad doesn't like his banana bread with chocolate chips, so I'll be adding in that one to this website as well. But I found this one is not too moist or too dry, it's the perfect blend of both. When you cut it, it doesn't squish or crumble, it hold's it's shape even when you freeze them.</p>
